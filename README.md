## Description 📏
The console is like the opening act in the grand play that is the AirBnB Clone Project at ALX Holberton School. 🎭 This project is the gateway to the magical world of higher-level programming concepts. Our mission? To bring to life a simplified version of the AirBnB website on your server.

In this enchanting segment, behold the birth of a command interpreter that manages objects for the AirBnB website (HBnB). 🌟 This is our humble beginning, laying the foundation for the majestic AirBnB clone.

### Features:
✨ Create new objects (e.g., User or Place)  
✨ Retrieve objects from files, databases, and beyond  
✨ Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)  
✨ Update attributes of an object  
✨ Destroy an object  

## Installation 💾
1. Navigate to the AirBnB directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
2. Run the console interactively: `./console` and let the magic begin!
3. Run the console non-interactively: `echo "<command>" | ./console.py` for a touch of wizardry.
