Description :triangular_ruler:
The console represents the initial phase of the AirBnB project at ALX Holbertn School. This project covers fundamental concepts of higher-level programming. The ultimate objective is to deploy a basic replica of the AirBnB website (HBnB) on our server.

In this initial segment, a command interpreter is developed to manage objects for the AirBnB (HBnB) website. This marks the first step towards creating our full web application, the AirBnB clone.

Features:
The command interpreter enables users to perform various operations on AirBnB clone objects, including:

Creating a new object (e.g., User or Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, database, etc.
Performing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object
Installation :floppy_disk:
Navigate to the AirBnB directory: cd AirBnB_clone
Run the console interactively: ./console and enter commands
Run the console non-interactively: echo "<command>" | ./console.py
